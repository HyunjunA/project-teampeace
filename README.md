# INF 554 Assignment for 5

## Slide 1 (Slide 1 - 3 : Introduction)

The title of our project is Information Visualization of the Correlates of War Dataset
Our group name is Team Peace

### Why you chose this project?
- There are some websites which provide visual information on war problems. But to understand this information, users should have domain knowledge in this field. Also, this information is limited. So, we want to make websites where people easily access and understand these problems. Providing people information on conflicts is important because it can help the public think how they can live together with their neighboring countries peacefully. 

-  Also, we think spending our passion and energy for works which are related to peace is awesome.
### What is the story?
 There are 7 datasets that we are using. 
- War dataset
- National Material Capabilities
- World Religion Data
- Militarized Interstate Disputes & Locations
- Formal Alliances
- Territorial Change
- Trade. 
 All of these were downloaded from the correlates of war website.

 By giving this information to people, we want to explain and summarize how these values for each of the countries have changed over time. For example, political scientists have proved that interdependence on economical things have positive effects on deterring wars among countries. By showing the network of trade and conflict data, we can show that one way to deter war can be having good trade relationships.

## Slide 2
### Why is your project interesting?
- First, it can help people understand world in the international aspect.
- Second, it stimulates people to think how human beings maintain world peace.  
### Why is your visualization important?
 In this project, the main purpose is to provide visual information in an easy way by making a web site.

### How is your visualization useful?
 Our visualization can be used to educate the public about this problem.

## Slide 3 
### Who is the audience for your project?
- Anyone who has never studied international war problems but wants to understand these problems and resolve these issues.
- Anyone who wants to get intuition under the war dataset by using information visualization.

## Slide 4 (Slide 4 - 8 : Visualization)
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 By using the COW war datasets, we can show the visual information about: 
- How many wars have occurred from 1816-2016?
- How many people have passed away because of each conflict? 
- What countries took part and what type of war it was? 
- Time period of the wars? 
- How each war ended?

## Slide 5
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 By using militarized interstate disputes and locations, we can visualize where countries took part in conflicts. We draw this information on the map. Therefore, users can know the exact location where each conflict has occurred, number of wars that took place in each area, and how many people passed away in each conflict area. To visualize all these kinds of information, we make use of cartogram, proportional symbol map, dot map, etc.

## Slide 6
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 Each country's national material capabilities is one important factor which can be linked with number of deaths. By using this information, we can show the countries that have a prominent effect on world peace and war. One of the simplest comparison is to use military expenditure for each of the countries. The trend in the change of military expenditure every year can be observed. We can also show the correlation between fatalities and national capacities index. The amount of Iron and steel produced versus the total population comparison can be used. 

## Slide 7
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 Visual information about how alliances have changed is showed with the formal alliances dataset. By using network of countries, we can help people understand how relationships between countries have changed over time.

 By using world religion data, we can show the major religions people follow in different parts of the world. This data will be visualized on the map. We can draw this information globally, nationally, and regionally.

## Slide 8
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 Trade is known as one of factors to deter wars among countries. By using this trade data, we can show:
- How the amount of trade has changed over time between each country?
- Which countries are most interdependent on each other?( This information can be visualized with the Chord diagram)
- The number of wars between countries that have good trade relationships with each other?
- The number of war between countries which have do not have good trade relationships with each other?

 By using territorial change, we can show the behavior of each country. 

## Slide 9
### What are your design considerations?
- Affordance for interactive elements.
- Making use of Hover-and-click animations. For example, the Hover-and-click animation is used to provide additional information for a particular region and a specific year in a map showing battle related deaths in state based conflicts since 1946.
- Clean UI.
- Simple color palette that is very easy to see.
- Legible and readable text.


## Slide 10
### What are the components that make your visualization cool?
- Visualizations that are more interactive and explorative in nature.
- Making use of novel charts, maps that people don't usually encounter in daily life.
- More information visualizations that are multidimensional in nature. 

### How does your visualization compare to what others have done?
 There are some websites which provide information visualizations on war related datasets. 
- The first one is International Conflict Research in ETH Zurich, Swiss. 
- The second one is Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) in Uppsala University, Sweden.

 These websites provide visual information on international conflict problems but each website has only limited information. 

## Slide 11(What is your plan) 
### What are the technologies you plan to use?
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript
- D3.js
- Bootstrap
- Vue.js
- Inkscape
- Sketch

## Slide 12(How are you going to design, build, and evaluate?)
### Design & Build
- Our information visualizations would be more multidimensional and dense in nature.
- Our focus would be more on functionality rather than visual style.  

### Evaluate
 The two websites(International Conflict Research in ETH Zurich and Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) in Uppsala University can be used as a reference point to compare our website with.
 By making the visualization wheels of the websites, we can analyze and compare their features in more detail.
 
### What data will you use, how will you obtain it?
 We downloaded the data sets from the correlates of war website. This is a renowned website to researchers in the field of international conflict.
