# INF 554 Assignment for 5

## Slide 1 (Slide 1 - 3 : Introduction)

### Why you chose this project?
 There are some websites which provide visual information on war problems. But to understand this information, users should have domain knowledge in this field. Also, this information is limited. So, we want to make websites where people easily access and understand these problems. Providing people information on conflicts is important because it can help the public think how they can live together with their neighboring countries peacefully. 

 Also, we think spending our passion and energy for works which are related to peace is awesome.
### What is the story?
 There are 7 datasets. War dataset, National Material Capabilities, World Religion Data, Militarized Interstate Disputes & Locations, Formal Alliances, Territorial Change, and Trade. These all were download from the correlates of war.

 By giving these information to people, we want to explain and summarize how these values for each of the countries have changed over time. 

 For example, political scientists have proved that interdependence on economical things have positive effects on deterring wars among countries. By showing the network of trade and conflict data, we can show that one way to deter war can be having good trade relationships.

 
## Slide 2
### Why is your project interesting?
 First, it can help people understand world in the international aspect.
 Second, it stimulates people to think how human beings maintain world peace.  
### Why is your visualization important?
 In this project, the main purpose is to provide visual information in an easy way by making a web site.

### How is your visualization useful?
 Our visualization can be used to educate the public about this problem.

## Slide 3 
### Who is the audience for your project?
 Anyone who has never studied international war problems but wants to understand these problems and resolve these issues.
 Anyone who wants to get intuition under the war dataset by using information visualization.

## Slide 4 (Slide 4 - 8 : Visualization)
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 First, by using the COW war data, we can show the visual information about how many wars have occurred from 1816-2016,How many people have passed away because of each conflict, What countries have took participated in what kinds of war, How long countries have fought, and How each war was over.

## Slide 5
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 Second, by using militarized interstate disputes and location, we can visualize where countries took participate in conflicts. We draw this information on the map. Therefore users can know where each conflict has been occurred, How many wars have been existed in each area, and how many people passed away in each conflict area. To visualize all this kind of information, we can use cartogram, proportional symbol map, and dot map

## Slide 6
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 Third, each countries of national material capabilities are important one of factors. By using this information, we can show that which countries can have prominent effects on world peace and wars. One of the simplest comparison is to use military expenditure of each countries. And change of military expenditure by year is used. We can also show the correlation between fatalities and national capacities index. In the industry, the amount of producing Iron and steel and total population comparison can be used. 

## Slide 7
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 Fourth, visual information about how alliances have changed is showed with formal alliances dataset. By using network of countries, we can help the public understand how the relationships have changed.

 Fifth, by using world religion data, we can show What kind of religions people believe in each area. This data will be visualized on the map. we can draw this information globally, nationally, and regionally.


## Slide 8
### What are you telling with your visualization?
 Sixth, trade is known as one of factors to deter wars among countries. By using this trade data, we can show how the amount of trade has been changed between each country, Which countries are most interdependent on trade each other( this information can be visualized with the Chord diagram), the number of war between countries which have traded, the number of war between countries which have not traded. 

 Seventh, by using territorial change, we can show how each countries have behaved. 

## Slide 9
### What are your design considerations?
    ??????????????????????????????????????????????????
## Slide 10
### What are the components that make your visualization cool?
 ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
### How does your visualization compare to what others have done?
 There are some websites which provide information visualization. The first one is International Conflict Research in ETH Zurich, Swiss. The second one is Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) in Uppsala University, Sweden.

 These websites provide visual information on international conflict problems. But each website provide limited information. 

## Slide 11(What is your plan) 
### What are the technologies you plan to use?

## Slide 12(How are you going to design, build, and evaluate?)
### Design & Build
 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????

### Evaluate
 The two websites(International Conflict Research in ETH Zurich and Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) in Uppsala University) are be able to use to compare. We can compare our website with them.
 By making visualization wheel of each website, we can analyze and compare.
### What data will you use, how will you obtain it?
 I download the data sets from the correlates of war. This web site is well known to researchers in international conflict.
