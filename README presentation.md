## Slide 1 - 2  Introduction

The title of our project is Information Visualization of the Correlates of War Dataset.
The World is Changing in war and peace and Why it is changing.

Our group name is Team Peace.
Introduction leading with 10 words on what wer visualization is about
- Military Expenditure, Wars, Militarized Interstate Disputes, and  international Trade
and relationship between international trade and the number of Countries at war by year

Explain who is it addressed to
- The public who want to know Wars, Military Expenditure, Militarized Interstate Disputes, and Trade, 

why it is interesting, original, useful
- To public, we can explain the story in easy ways with data visualization.
How these figures of military expenditue, wars, MIDs, and International Trade has changed.
When people, who are not experts in this field, want to understand this problem broadly, 
it can helps people to get intuition about this problem.


## Slide 3
### Explain the data and topic as needed to understand the project.
- Military Expenditure data
A military budget (or military expenditure), also known as a defense budget, is the amount of financial resources dedicated by a state to raising and maintaining an armed forces or other methods essential for defense purposes. In this project, we use Military Expenditure(%) of GDP.

- MIDs data
Militarized Interstate Disputes are conflicts between states that do not involve a full-scale war.
A conflict is described as an MID if it cauese fewer than 1000 deaths, and some military force is used.

- War data
Wars involve a full-scale war.
A conflict is described as an War if it cauese more than 1000 deaths, and military force is used.

- Trade data
trade flows between states (as defined by the Correlates of War project) for the period 1870-2014. The data include information on both bilateral trade flows and total national imports and exports. 
The dyadic trade dataset describes import and export data in current U.S. dollars for pairs of sovereign states. The National (Monadic) Trade dataset contains information on individual states import and export levels in current U.S. dollars.


## Slide 4-14
### Explain the research we have done, what others have done in the same topic, other topics that are relevant.  
- Military Expenditure in Slide 4-5  
- Slide 4 (Giving information about the military expenditure of major countries)
  To understand current situations of Militarized Disputes and Wars in world, knowing their military expenditure of major countries is important, because they have had significant effects on international peace. By providing this information, readers can check whether these major countries have compete in arms, which has negative effects on world peace.

  Therefore, by using the bubble cloud, I want to give the information about how much percentage of it's GDP major countries spend strengthening military power.
  With the animated bar chart, reader can know the ranking of the expenditure.
  

- Slide 5 (Showing military expenditure of major countries on the map)
  By showing information about the share of entire military expenditure on the Map, I want to give inforamtion about which country has hegamony in each area, and which countries may compete in military power in each area and world. This information shows which area are peceful compared to other areas.  

  The line chart makes readers understand how major countries have spent the expenditure in military. The purpose of this chart is to show whether major countries have competed in militray or not. By using the line chart, reader can understand most of major countries have remained the percentage, instead of increasing the percentaage, which can makes tension.

- War, MIDs, and International Trade in Slide 6-12 
- Slide 6 shows the average number of countries at wars by year. And you can check what is major war during each period. The purpose of this chart is to give user broad understanding of when many countries have wars, and in recent years, how many countries took part in wars.

- Slide 7-10 shows the information about MIDs, War, and Trade. 
  By showing the mids inforamtion with bar chart and map, user can understand how the number of mids have changed and which area is the most disputed area by year.   

  By showing the number of countries at war with bar chart and map, user can understand when countries have joined wars.    

  By showing the number of countries at trade with bar chart and map, user can understand how many countries take part in international trade and whether the number of countries at trade increases or decreases.

  The purpose of this page is to give some intutition about relationships between the number of countires at wars and the number of countries at trade. 

- Slide 11-12
  Before showing the change between the number of countries at wars and the number of countries at trade and change between the number of countries at wars and the total amount trade, I want to show this pie chart.

  This pie chart shows the most of trade dependency for all war cases between countries was lower than 0.1. 

- Slide 13
  Let's see the change between the number of countries at wars and the number of countries at trade and change between the number of countries at wars and the total amount trade, I want to show this pie chart.

  As you can see here, there is some negative correlation between the number of countries at wars and the number of countries at trade by years. And, there is some negative correlation between the number of countries at wars and total amount international trade by years. 


  Many Liberalists interpreate this phenomenon and believe trade has posivitve effects in developing each countries. And in many cases, the countries which is developed hesitate to join war, because of a lot of negative effects such as increasing military expenditure, decreasing expenditure for other social parts, social insecure,and etc.

- Slide 14
  These Liberalists believe this phenomena ruled by two factors:
  They are international institutions, and International trade.

  First, it is international institutions, such as the United Nations, who provide a forum to resolve disputes in a non-violent way.  
  
  Second, it is International trade because when countries' economies are interconnected through trade, they are less likely to go to war with each other.


## Slide 15
Explain your design process, rationale for the layout, story, choice of forms:

- Simple and clean layout which is easy to understand.
- Well designed pages with good story flow.
- Made use of frequently used charts like line chart, pie chart, etc. so that even users who are new to this domain of wars and disputes can easily understand the information.
- Most of the charts that were used are ones that are familiar and popular with the average user. 
- This was done to grab the attention of the user initially and maintain the interest of the user long enough till they can explore novel and complex visualizations.


Explain choice of forms, how you optimized the visual queries and user interaction and how your work is original:

- Made use of bar charts and maps together to show the multilevel, multidimensional visualization of information.
- Users can easily explore MIDs, Wars and Trade datasets with a single click and find patterns, relations between these entities.
- By showing different views at once, it is more informative and exploratory in nature to the user.
- This kind of visualization are very useful to political scientists or people who are interested in getting specific information.
- For example, if the user hovers a bar for the year 1986, the corresponding information is shown in the map below. 


## Slide 16
List of required d3 features to include:

- Affordance for interactive elements.
- Making use of Hover-and-click animations.
- Clean UI.
- Simple color palette that is very easy to see.
- Legible and readable text.
- Responsive and Interactive D3 charts.

- Animated Chart.
- Here, we use an animated bar chart which can be used to filter and sort the data according to our requirements.
- We also make use of D3 Maps in our project.
- Here, we show a proportional symbol map showing the share of military expenditure.

## Slide 17
Highlight what you have built:

- The Bubble Chart displays the summarized as well as specific information of wars over a particular period of time.
- For example, when we hover the bubble 1988-2003, it shows the number of countries involved in war each year and the major war which took place during this time range. 
- The Scatter Plot summarizes the relation between war and trade.
- General pattern observered is that if more number of countries are involved in war, the international trade value is low.
- If more countries are peaceful and not involved in any kind of war, the international trade value is high. 
 
## Slide 18
What others have done in the same topic and other topics that are relevant:
- There are many books, magazine, papers in international relations field. Some universities, research institute, international organization such as UN have their specific web pages which provide simple data visualization. In many cases, there provide simple facts in the data set, which does not have any story about data. I always feel if there are web pages that provide data visualization about international relations, the webpages are made in simple story, I thought it is useful. Therefore with story and data, we made the web page.
